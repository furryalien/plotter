No instructions were in the box. Contacting the seller via Aliexpress got me instructions including Inkscape setup for the most part.
The instructions were clean when scanned via Virus Total
The PDF's had mostly chinese text in them. Not too bad. The pictures were more than enough to get things set.
I did have a few things that I assembled, disassembled, and reassembled. No big deal, just dont tighten everything a ton until you are done.

The instructions are pretty good overall.

I wasnt able to get it to work with any software other than what was provided.

The board was able to be flashed with the latest EBB firmware via https://wiki.evilmadscientist.com/Installing_software
