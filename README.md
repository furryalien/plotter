No instructions were not in the box. This seems to be a FAQ for the sellers, and they advise that customs often does not allow the USB device that is part of the shipment

Contacting the seller via Aliexpress got me a link to a google drive with instructions including Inkscape setup for the most part.

The instructions were clean when scanned via Virus Total

The PDF's had mostly chinese text in them. Not too bad. The pictures were more than enough to get things set.

I did have a few things that I assembled, disassembled, and reassembled. No big deal, just dont tighten everything a ton until you are done.

The instructions are pretty good overall.

Alignment was challenging and took a bit of time. Here are some tips based on my experience.

First, do initial assembly and testing to make sure things are working.

To do alignment
* move carriage to the center, all axis
* loosen the bolts that hold the carriage to the rail, yes all of them
* Mark a location on the y-axis, I used blue masking tape and 23 cm from the rail end.
* Use zip tie to hold that location
* Tighten belts making sure they are properly on the bearings/rollers at each step
* Do final belt tightening
* Do final carriage bolt tightening
* remove the zip ties (or whatever you need to to to release the carriage)
* Do micro adjustments as necessary
* Test, repeat as necessary

clamps for the belt

I didnt like that it wanted me to use zip ties so I used binder clips to start with. Even after tweaking I still didnt like it. I looked at a few different 3d printed options, but didnt want to mess with that. So I kept thinkging about it. I wanted something that could work like a hinge so that it would pinch and release as necessary. There are a few 3d printed models that were close to this but not exactly what I wanted. After ruminating for a bit I remembered that I had a number of old bicycle chains, and that when disassembled, the links could be connected with M3 bolts and nuts to create a pinch point so thats what I did. They work well.
